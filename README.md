# Perceptron Algorithm

It is aimed to show how the Perceptron algorithm will be implemented on a simple scenario. This scenario finds weights based on basic inputs and weights randomly determined at the beginning. At the same time, it determines the performance of the software developers in YazilimciFirmasi.csv according to the weights found. In summary, basically how to determine whether the performance of employees in a company is efficient or inefficient and how to calculate a perceptron network? is the answer to the question.

The performance graph of the software developers in a list is represented under the name result.png.
